# QUALITIES

- slug: halide-free
  text: Halide free
  icon: leaves
  category: "quality"
  gist: Halides are harmful to our environmental and can pose health risks. All Interflux products are completely halide-free (0,00%).

- slug: alcohol-based
  text: Alcohol based (VOC)
  icon: alcohol
  category: "quality"

- slug: water-based
  text: Water based
  icon: water
  category: "quality"
  gist: The two reasons why you will want to use water-based soldering fluxes is because they are 1) not flamable and 2) completely halide-free. None-flamable soldering fluxes are easier to transport, require less paperwork, are safer to store and use. Halide-free fluxes are popular because they do not harm the ozon layer.

- slug: low-melting-point
  text: Low melting point
  icon: low-temperature
  category: "quality"
  gist: "Soldering electronics at lower temperatures reduced the risks like damaging sensitive components and warping the circuits boards. It also helps you reduce energy costs."

- slug: low-voiding
  text: Low voiding (below 10%)
  icon: low-voiding
  category: "quality"
  gist: "Voids are bubbles of air in solder alloys that get trapped between electronic component and their circuit board. They are typically found underneath components with big flat surfaces like BGAs, often taking up 50 to 20% of the surface. Use Xrays to spot them. The're bad becasue the reduce the mechanical strength of the solder joint as well conductivity. Low voiding means we keep those bubbles to a minimum, below 10%"

- slug: no-clean
  text: No Clean™ - no post cleaning needed
  icon: no-clean
  category: "quality"
  gist: "No Clean™ is a hallmark quality label of Interflux for solder pastes which leave little to no residue on the circuits boards. No post-cleaning is required, greatly decreasing your cost per unit, reduce risk of defects and increase production speed."

- slug: for-lead-and-lead-free-processes
  text: for both SnPb and lead-free processes
  icon: lead-and-lead-free
  category: "quality"
  gist: "For those that use the same machines to for lead-based and lead-free manufacturing, it's important that their solder fluxes and solder pastes are compatible with all alloys."
