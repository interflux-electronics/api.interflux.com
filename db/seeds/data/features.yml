  gist: Halides are harmful to our environmental and can pose health risks. All Interflux products are completely halide-free (0,00%).

  gist: The two reasons why you will want to use water-based soldering fluxes is because they are 1) not flamable and 2) completely halide-free. None-flamable soldering fluxes are easier to transport, require less paperwork, are safer to store and use. Halide-free fluxes are popular because they do not harm the ozon layer.
