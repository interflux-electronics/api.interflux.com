  pitch: The Revolutionary Selective Jet Fluxer is designed to control the amount of flux for each solder joint without losing the ability to maintain the required cycle time demanded by wave soldering processes. The Jet technology used replaces completely the need of spray technology. As a result, the ICSF-Select offers a Total Flux Process control needed for today’s more demanding and complicated soldering requirements, especially lead-free processes. The ability to program points, lines, multi-lines, areas allows the engineer to decide how much flux/pressure is required for certain solder joints up to complete areas. This capability opens up the process window without risking excess of flux residues. Thanks to the XY-movement speed up to 1,500 mm/s, the cycle time will be up to the standard required for wave soldering mass production.
